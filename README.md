rstat.us is a microblogging site built on top of the [ostatus
protocol](http://status.net/wiki/OStatus).

The differences between rstat.us and other microblogging networks are *simplicity* and *openness*.

*Simplicity* is a core 'feature' of rstat.us. We pride ourselves on saying 'no' to lots of features. Our interface is clean, and easy to understand. We give you just enough features to be interesting, but not enough to be complicated and confusing.

*Openness* means the programming code that makes up rstat.us is available for anyone to download, free of charge. Programmers can use that code to run their own websites just like rstat.us, and you can subscribe to your friends on any site that supports the OStatus protocol, like identi.ca. This also means that you can own your data; we'll never stop you from having full access to everything you've put into rstat.us.

## Development Roadmap

In the first half of 2012, we plan to work on:
- Fixing user-facing bugs or cutting buggy parts of the app
- Fixing OStatus support
- Implementing a RESTful API
- Supporting and documenting running your own node

Please see the [Issues](http://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us/issues), anything without an assignee is up for grabs! Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification either on an issue itself or through one of the contact methods listed above.

Source code documentation
-------------------------

We have documentation that explains our source code using rocco.
You can view it [here](http://hotsh.github.com/rstat.us/rstatus.html).


Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

First off: you will need MongoDB (www.mongodb.org).  They have a [quickstart
guide][mongo-quickstart] for getting it installed and running.

Then do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/$MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/rstat.us.git
    $ cd rstat.us

Then update your gemset:

    $ gem install bundler && bundle install

And start the server:

    $ rails server

Bam! Visit <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser, and you'll be good.

To run the tests you may want to make use of `bundle exec` so you don't get
mixed up with different versions of gems that might or might not work with
the current rstat.us branch.

Run all the tests:

    $ bundle exec rake test

You can run convenient subsets of the tests during development; run `bundle exec rake -T` to see all the options. You can also run one test file (for example, `test/models/author_test.rb`) by specifying the filepath in the TEST environment variable:

    $ bundle exec rake test TEST=test/models/author_test.rb

Please run all the tests before submitting a pull request!

Running your own node
---------------------

We're working on making this super easy, but right now, we're not quite there.

If you do run your own node, please keep current with upstream.
